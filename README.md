The purpose of this repository is to document the Project work.

Currently the structure is as follows:

- [Project Management](/project-management) - All project management related stuff is in here, e.g. meetings outcomes, retrospectives, screenshots, minutes, planning.
- [Analysis](/analysis) - this is the folder where we put all analysis artefacts into.
- [Design](/design) - this is the folder where we put all design artefacts into.
- [Implementation](/implementation) - this is the folder where we put all analysis artefacts into.
- [Resources](/resources) - this is the folder where we put all additional resources.
- [Documentation](/documentation) - this is the folder where we put all documents related to the project.

Preferably document with markdown files or AsciiDoc.
