As a product owner, I was responsible for frequently updating the product backlog. After every sprint planning meeting, I set up the "To Do" log for the next sprint. At the start of every meeting of the group, I basically communicated the current status of our work and where we are right now. What we are actually doing in a specific meeting is either decided by the group itself or by me. I prioritized the different worked out user stories and based on that, put them into the "To Do" log for each sprint.
